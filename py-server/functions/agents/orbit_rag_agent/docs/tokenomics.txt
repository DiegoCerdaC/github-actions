Our token is designed to power the platform’s **token-gating** features and provide long-term value via **buybacks** and **reward distributions** to holders.
## **Token Utility**
• **Platform Access & Token Gating**
Token holders gain exclusive access to premium features, community events, and product upgrades.
• **Buybacks & Rewards**

## **Revenue Collection & Buyback Mechanism**
1.  **Collecting Revenue**
• Transaction fee taken or swapped to **stablecoins** (e.g., USDC) or **major cryptocurrencies** (e.g., SOL). This approach reduces volatility and allows strategic timing for token buybacks.
2.  **Buyback Allocation**
• A **fixed portion** (**30–50%** of net revenue) is used for **open-market buybacks** of the token.
• The remaining revenue covers operational costs, further product development, and business expansion.
3.  **Token Distribution**
•  **redistributed** to long-term holders, stakers, or liquidity providers, aligning incentives and rewarding community participation.
## **Why This Structure Works**
• **Immediate Liquidity** (2%) reduces volatility and builds early trust.
• **Steady Treasury Unlocks** (5%) let the project adapt monthly for marketing, listings, and operations.
• **Community Allocations** (2%) in multiple unlocks spark ongoing engagement and rewards.
• **Long-Term Lock** (3% for Team & Investors) emphasizes commitment and reduces dump risk.
Overall, this balanced approach provides a stable environment for organic growth, ensures fair community participation, and aligns the project’s success with token holder interests.
