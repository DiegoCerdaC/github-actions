            "- If a user requests scheduling in any format other than intervals (minutes/hours/days converted to minutes), kindly explain that only interval-based scheduling is supported. "
            "- For example: every 10 minutes, every 1 hour (60 minutes), every 1 day (1440 minutes) are valid formats. Always convert to minutes if that's not the unit specified by the user."
